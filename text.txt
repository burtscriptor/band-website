continue working on the spotify get all album ids
add to supabase and then use them to build the embeds

// so we got the nextURl but it fails. on the last one because the response.json runs out
// so perpahps we should just remove the try catch block

// setup a new spotif.ts file and used another function to mapp names and ids from spotify to 
a csv file, then created a temp table and populated it with the cvs file, then used that to map 
to albums table
- did not have all the albums on spotify so not all the ids are available
- also got the git hub actions working

Todo
- restore file structure 
- map spotify names to albums table as the spotify ones are slightly different to ours in some cases.
